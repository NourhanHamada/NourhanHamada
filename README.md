<h3>About Me 👩🏻‍💻</h3>
I am a Flutter developer.

I began my development journey with web technologies in 2021 and quickly transitioned to mobile development using Flutter and Dart. I have developed multiple mobile applications, including:
- Mostwak App
- Rtb App
- Fixo App
- Catching Kowa App
- Istehwath Multi vendor App
- Khayal stations App (360 - VR videos)
- Syria Pay App
- EQM Desktop
- Dw2ni multi vendor App

I'm passionate about **clean code principles** and continuously learning *new technologies*.


## Future Goals 🚀
- Deep dive into iOS native development using Swift.
- Expand expertise in state management libraries in Flutter.
